# FracPY - Fractal Generator

Welcome to **FracPY**, a Python program that generates stunning fractals using the Sierpinski Triangle and Mandelbrot Set. This project combines artistic visualization with mathematical beauty, allowing users to explore the infinite complexity of fractals.

## Features

- **Two Fractal Types**: Generate the Sierpinski Triangle or the Mandelbrot Set.
- **User Input**: Customize the number of fractals, recursion depth, output directory, and fractal color through an intuitive GUI.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Each fractal is generated in real-time, offering a unique artistic experience.
